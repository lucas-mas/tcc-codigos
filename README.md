# tcc-scripts
Scripts used to analyze HTE, HTEWMA, HTESW, SMA and EWMA convergence time.

Numerical simulators for the five methods are in the "simulators" folder.

The idea is that the scripts are released gradually. I think it's better to organize the codes first.

There are several other scripts:
- Accuracy calculator
- Variability calculator
- Convergence time calculator
- Accuracy, variability and convergence time graph generators
- And some others
